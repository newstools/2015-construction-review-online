The Government of Rwanda through the Ministry of Infrastructure has announced plans to rehabilitate and pave more roads across the country. The country hopes to achieve its second Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) goals through upgrading and repairing additional 7,192Kms of roads.

The Minister for Infrastructure, James Musoni indicated that the roads that will benefit from the construction project to include the 208km Kagitumba-Kayonza-Rusumo road, 63Km Butaro-Kidaho road, 185Km Kivu belt and the 125Km Base-Gicumbi-Nyagatare road. USD 11m had been set aside in the fiscal year 2014/2015 for the roads construction project. The Road Transport Development Agency has drafted a report on the identified class II roads that will be improved and is just waiting for cabinets’ approval.
