Rwanda is planning to construct a world-class modern logistics facility at Kigali International Airport; this comes after a signing between the government and DHL Express. Charles Brewer, the DHL Express Managing Director for sub-Saharan Africa, confirmed the reports and said that the facility will operate as an airside transit gateway, adding that the company wants to use Rwanda as a hub for its operations in East African region and help boost export trade in the country. “Construction will commence in August and it will take a period of nine months to be complete,” said Brewer. DHL is expected to chip in US$ 3.5m to see the logistic facility come to reality. It is anticipated that the development will make it possible for small-and-medium entrepreneurs to access services at affordable prices. “This is an important development that will significantly improve the logistics sector, and will also support government’s efforts geared at enhancing the industry,” Julie Mutoni, DHL Express Rwanda chief said. The development is projected to have an air and land access, accommodating the firm’s country office, courier operations gateway, warehouse, transport vehicles and other operational equipment. Logistical facilities are usually used as part of the bench mark to negotiate trade with investors. It is anticipated that establishing some of these facilities in the country will make Rwanda more competitive and help heighten export trade. DHL Express is a division of the German logistics company Deutsche Post DHL providing international express mail services. Deutsche Post is the world’s largest logistics company operating around the world.
