A four-star hotel funded byu FIFA Goal project will be constructed in Rwanda as from next month, July by Rwanda Football Federation (FERWAFA); this is according to the Federation president Vincent Nzamwita. The hotel is anticipated to lessen the expenses that the Ministry of Sports and Culture (MINISPOC) incurs on national teams during residential training or accommodation for visiting national teams. Apart from it being used by the national teams, FERWAFA is also planning to use it for commercial purposes so as to help in the generation of income for different sports activities. The development which will cost US$ 6m is projected to be built in four phases with the first phase including the construction of 40 rooms. In total it will consist of 100 rooms. FIFA Goal Project Programme has provided a grant of US$ 3m towards the project while the other half will be sourced from a loan. It will be erected on a land next to the FERWAFA headquarters in Remera, currently occupied by Rwanda Police. This project is part of the FIFA Goal project development programme aimed at helping developing countries mainly in Africa and Asia to establish infrastructure and facilities to boost the growth of the game. To date, it has provided support to over 500 development projects, with US$ 200m invested.
