Rwanda is currently planning to add another 70MW of power to the national grid before end of this year. This will lead to better accessibility of electricity, exploiting national resources for energy and enhancing regional integration. This comes after Rwanda’s president; Mr. Paul Kagame inaugurated the Nyabarongo I Hydro-power plant located in Mushishiro Sector of Muhanga District, Southern Province. The plant adds 28MW to Rwanda’s power grid and will play a key role in powering the country’s economic transformation. Infrastructure minister, James Musoni said they were targeting other energy or power generation projects to get 300 megawatts by 2018. According to research, Rwanda has one of the lowest electricity consumption per capita in the region, and has low power generation capacity with 86.3% of total generation coming from biomass and 13.7% coming from petroleum products. The country has large methane gas reserves that can be useful for electricity generation. Rwanda is targeting at making maximum use of energy mix in order to become a middle income country by 2020.
