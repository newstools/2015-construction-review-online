Construction of 7,480 housing units in Kigali, Rwanda has finally kicked off as the Minister for Infrastructure; James Musoni broke the ground on 26th February in Batsinda where the construction will take place. The Batsinda II will involve Kanombe and Ndera Affordable Housing Project where 2000 units will be constructed in each project, Rugarama where 2,743 units will be constructed and 128 housing units for the Ziniya Pilot Project. Construction will be done in phase’s beginning this month starting with roads, and the estate is expected to be ready in two years time. It will help quell demand of affordable housing in the country, expected to reach 560,000 units by 2020, meaning 93,400 units must be constructed every year from now. The Rwandan Government decided on this initiative so as to provide affordable and better homes for the area residents as this is part of a larger plan to urbanize the city. They also decided on it as part of expanding and growing as the country develops towards vision 2030 where urbanization rate is expected to increase to 35 per cent by the year 2020 from 17 per cent in 2012. The urban population will increase from the current 1.7 million to 4.4 million, which is an increase of about 2. 7 million people living in urban areas. “We have started affordable housing projects in Kigali but we want to extend the programmes to other parts of the country, especially in the six secondary cities,” Musoni said. The other cities are listed as Rubavu, Musanze, Nyagatare, Muhanga, Huye and Rusizi. The government will collaborate with the City of Kigali, the Development Bank of Rwanda, RSSB and Shelter Afrique group in undertaking the new housing construction project.
