The new plant which is also expected to help increase the output of the company will cost US$ 4m for it to be complete. Chief Executive of Crown Paints Rakesh Rao confirmed the reports and said that the new plant will foster growth and better service in that region since that have received a high percentage of sales from there. “Forty per cent of our sales come from this region and this plant will enable us serve the area better,” Rakesh said. “We are also spending a lot to transport the paint from Nairobi yet 70 per cent of paint is water so we are spending a lot to transport water,” He further said.
