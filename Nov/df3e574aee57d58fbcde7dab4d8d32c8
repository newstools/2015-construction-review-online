Chinese firm Sinohydro, has signed an infrastructure construction deal with Tatu City in Kenya. The deal will see the water, sewerage and temporary road works developed. The agreement worth US$ 4m will cater for basic infrastructure that will supplement the first phase of the project and another seven-kilometre temporary road will be constructed to help facilitate ongoing construction activities. “We are pleased to extend our co-operation with Sinohydro, which has already successfully completed several stages of Tatu City’s infrastructure development,” said Tatu City Acting CEO Anthony Njoroge. The 2,500-acre Tatu City in Kenya which is expected to be complete over the next year will host a number of international businesses like Dormans, Kim-Fay and Maxam. It is also expected to host over 70,000 residents when complete and people anticipate that it will help decongest the capital city by offering a unique live, work and play environment. Tatu City is located near operational and influential places like Jomo Kenyatta Airport, Runda, Kenyatta University, UniCity, Thika Highway and the Northern and Eastern bypasses. Sinohydro is originally well known as China’s first brand in hydropower construction, responsible for 65% of the large- and medium-scale hydropower stations in the country. It has 12 holdings and 20 wholly owned subsidiaries based in China, 5 regional offices abroad in Asia/Pacific, Africa, America, Eurasia and West Asia/North Africa to supervise the market development of 113 overseas offices in over 80 countries.
