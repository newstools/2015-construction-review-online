Cemtech Limited is set to commence in January the construction of a US$ 95m cement plant in Kenya in West Pokot County. The feasibility study for the project which was commissioned in 2010 by the Kerio Valley Development Authority (KVDA) shows that the area has large limestone deposits with the possibility of producing 1.2 million tons of cement annually. Cemtech’s General Manager, Diptish Nandha confirmed the news and said that they have finalized on the logistics that had initially led to the delay of the commencement for the past five years. “We have successfully solved the major two problems; one was the quality of limestone content which our experts have successfully managed to solve so we can now produce quality limestone. Our engineers have also managed to solve issues concerning the location and access to the plant,” said Mr Nandha. The cement plant in Kenya which will be on a 650 acre piece of land is expected to entail the construction of a 64MW power plant to be sold to the national grid, a friendly cement factory, staff houses, schools, a medical centre and other amenities. In Kenya, cement factories are currently enjoying increased demand because of the major projects such as the Standard Gauge Railway, construction of major shopping malls across the country and the growing real estate business. CEMTECH Limited is a Kenya based Cement Company registered to set up a Green field cement plant in Pokot District of Western Kenya. They plan to supply cement produce from this plant to the domestic market of western and central Kenya as well as export market of Uganda and Sudan.
