Dr. Alexis Nzahabwanimana, the State Minister for Transport confirmed the reports and said that the construction will take 12 months for it to be complete and will lead to saving of a lot of expenditure. “A parallel taxiway enhances expedited turnaround of air carriers thus saving time, burning less fuel and saving money,” Nzahabwanimana pointed out. The construction of Kigali International Airport in Rwanda which is being undertaken by Mota-Engil Africa will assist in the enhancement of the aviation sector and position Rwanda as one of the aviation hubs in the region going forward. Alex Buterere, the RwandAir senior manager in charge of grounds operations, said that such initiatives will significantly boost Rwanda Civil Aviation Authority’s capacity to handle the increasing air traffic at Kigali International Airport and reduce the cost of doing business besides growing the aviation industry. Mota-Engil Africa is one of the leading providers of integrated engineering and construction services in sub-Saharan Africa. Kigali International Airport has recently experienced growth in international and domestic arrivals from 263,264 in 2008 to 600,000 passengers currently, credit to the US$17.8 million rehabilitation and expansion project that was concluded last year. Under the project, the interior of the terminal building was given a ‘more appealing’ architectural outlook and expanded to handle 1.5 million passengers per year.
